## About

I am a Ph.D. student supervised by [Ivan Oseledets](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5kMqBQEAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Skoltech](https:\\www.skoltech.ru). My research interests lie in the area of unsupervised machine learning, more specifically my research is focused on developing robust and scalable generative models.

My resume is [here](cv.pdf).
